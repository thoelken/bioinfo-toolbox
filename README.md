# Bioinformatic Toolbox
Assortment of scripts and tools I use to manipulate and analyze common sequencing related data.

## Requirements
- Python 3
    - pysam
    - biopython
- Perl
- gawk/awk
- sed
- shell scripts are made for `bash`
- samtools
- sratools

## Usage
Most tools (in Python) come with a CLI explained with `--help`. Especially simple tools, shell and perl scripts are commonly used by piping input in and output out. Some cases will just require a filename as parameter. Especially shell, AWK and SED scripts are so short that you can please look at the source itself in order to figure out, how to use them.
